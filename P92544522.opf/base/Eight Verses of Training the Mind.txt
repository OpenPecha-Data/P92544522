Eight Verses of Training the Mind

by Geshe Langri Thangpa

By thinking of all sentient beingsAs more precious than a wish-fulfilling jewelFor accomplishing
the highest aim,I will always hold them dear.Whenever I’m in the company of others,I
will regard myself as the lowest among all,And from the depths of my heartCherish others as
supreme.In my every action, I will watch my mind,And the moment destructive emotions arise,I
will confront them strongly and avert them,Since they will hurt both me and others.Whenever
I see ill-natured beings,Or those overwhelmed by heavy misdeeds or suffering,I will
cherish them as something rare,As though I’d found a priceless treasure.Whenever someone
out of envyDoes me wrong by attacking or belittling me,I will take defeat upon myself,And
give the victory to others.Even when someone I have helped,Or in whom I have placed great
hopesMistreats me very unjustly,I will view that person as a true spiritual teacher.In brief,
directly or indirectly,I will offer help and happiness to all my mothers,And secretly
take upon myselfAll their hurt and suffering.I will learn to keep all these practicesUntainted
by thoughts of the eight worldly concerns.May I recognize all things as like illusions,And,
without attachment, gain freedom from bondage.
