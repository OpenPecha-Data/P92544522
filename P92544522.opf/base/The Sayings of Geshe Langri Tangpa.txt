The Sayings of Geshe Langri Tangpa

From the Collected Sayings of the Early Kadampa Masters

As no ordinary being can truly take the measure of another, do not disparage anyone at all.

As all the Buddha's teachings yield their own particular results, don't relate to them as good
or bad.

As there's nothing to do in the Great Vehicle but work for sentient beings, don't let your 'armour'[1]
for benefitting others be insubstantial.

As there can be no guiding others until you've seized the stronghold [of fruition] for yourself,
apply yourself to meditation in solitude.

Translated by Adam Pearcey, 2016

'Armour' here has the sense of 'courage' (AZR)  ↩
